# Jupyter Gateway Demos

Some demo's to get you started exposing APIs from your jupyter notebooks.

## Hello world

This demo shows how to build a collection of counters as RESTfull resources

### How to run

This demo requires conda (https://conda.io/docs/index.html) to be installed in the system. Also use curl to inspect that the API exposed by the notebook is working correctly. In order to run the demo use the provided Makefile as follows:

```
make install
make gateway
```

The above command will install the necessary packages in a demo conda environment and start the notebook in HTTP API gateway mode on `port 9000`, you can also inspect the notebook, by starting jupyter in notebook mode by running `make notebook` available on `port 8888`. When finished with this demo, you can remove the conda environment by typing `make uninstall`.

### Testing the API

You can find the latest notebook exposing the API here:  
https://github.com/natbusa/kernelgateway_demos/blob/master/hello-world/notebooks/getting-started.ipynb

#### Basic Data Type requests:

*Text*

```
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:9000/text 
```
```
hello world !
```

*json*
```
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:9000/json \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
```
{
  "hello": "world"
}
```

*data blob*
```
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:9000/image-data \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
```
data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==
```

*html snippet*
```
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:9000/image-html
```
```
<img src=data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg== />
```

#### A simple RESTful API:

The notebook shows also how you can keep a collection of counters, maintaining the counters state in the session memory of the executed jupyter notebook. Here below the API exposed as HTTP RESTful interface and makeing use of HTTP verbs.

get the current value of a counter :id
```
GET /counters/:id
```

create/set the counter :id to a given value
```
PUT /counters/:id
request body: {'value': value}
```

increment the counter :id by one, if not there create it with the value 1
```
POST /counters/:id
```

remove counter :id  
```
DELETE /counters/:id
```

list the whole collection of current counters
```
GET /counters
```

Example:
```
curl --request POST --url http://localhost:9000/counters/foo
curl --request POST --url http://localhost:9000/counters/bar

curl --request GET  --url http://localhost:9000/counters
[ {'foo': {'value':1}}, {'bar': {'value':1}} ]
```


## Iris classification

This demo shows how easy it is to explose train, and scoring ML functions straight from the notebook

The full API, including tuning, scoring, exploration exposing both json data as well as png images can be found on the following link: https://github.com/natbusa/kernelgateway_demos/blob/master/iris-classifier/notebooks/iris-classifier.ipynb

### How to run

This demo requires docker (https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) to be installed in the system. Also use curl or postman or your web browser to inspect that the API exposed by the notebook is working correctly.

You need to build the container with the command:
```
docker build . -t iris_webapp_demo
```

Type the following to run the container and expose the webapp on port 9000:
```
docker run -t -p 9000:9000 iris_webapp_demo
```

Demo will run on http://localhost:9000/public/index.html  

The full API, including tuning, scoring, exploration exposing both json data as well as png images can be found on the following link:   
https://github.com/natbusa/kernelgateway_demos/blob/master/iris-classifier/notebooks/iris-classifier.ipynb

When finished with this demo, you can remove stop and remove the container by typing:
```
docker kill iris_webapp_demo
docker rm iris_webapp_demo
```

### Notebook structure

In order to have the notebook working both in inline mode and in HTTP API serving mode with the kernel gateway we use an environment variable which is defined only while running the kernel gateway 
```python
KERNEL_GATEWAY = os.environ.get('KERNEL_GATEWAY', False)
```

Next to that we have number of utilities to export images as inline embedded <img> html snippets. and we mock the request data structure so we can test inline in the notebook before running the gateway and exposing the api

The Jupyter Kernel Gateway also exposes the list of end points via a swagger interface on:  
http://localhost:9000/_api/spec/swagger.json

For convenience the swagger UI (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) has been added to this docker container:
http://localhost:9000/public/swagger/index.html?url=http://localhost:9000/_api/spec/swagger.json

### Endpoints

#### Explore Data: Scatter plot
```
GET /plots/scatter/:x/:y
```

where :x and :y are dimension index from 0 to 3 according to the following list:  
`['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)']`

Try: http://localhost:9000/plots/scatter/0/1
![scatterplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natbusa/kernelgateway_demos/master/media/scatterplot.png)

#### Train Data
```
GET /model/train/:x/:y?model=:m
```

Will train the model according to two dimensions respectively :x, :y, and :m  

where :x and :y are dimension index from 0 to 3 according to the following list:  
`['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)']`

where :m from 0 to 5 fits one of the following models:
  - KNN Classifier
  - SVM classifier: linear kernel
  - SVM classifier: gaussian kernel
  - SVM classifier: polynomial kernel
  - Decision Tree
  - Decision Tree (depth limited)

For more information about this check   
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html

Try: http://localhost:9000/model/train/0/1?model=0,  
should produce the following text, and train a knn model for the iris data
```
KNeighborsClassifier(algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30, metric='minkowski',
           metric_params=None, n_jobs=1, n_neighbors=3, p=2,
           weights='uniform')
```

#### Classify Data Points on the trained model
```
GET /model/predict/?variable=:v
```

Will classify the data according to the trained model,  
where :v is a tuple of comma separated values, one for each dimension of the model

Try: http://localhost:9000/model/predict?variables=5.2,2.2
should score the tuple [5.2, 2.2] and produce the following text, 
```
versicolor
```

#### Model precision, recall, and classify regions
```
GET /model/confusion/plot
GET /model/predict/plot
```

Try: http://localhost:9000/model/confusion/plot
![confusion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natbusa/kernelgateway_demos/master/media/confusion.png)

Try: http://localhost:9000/model/predict/plot
![overlay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natbusa/kernelgateway_demos/master/media/overlay.png)

### Web App

You can use your favourite js and css framework to render the API exposed by the Jupyter Kernel Gateway. This demo uses a minimal jquery framework with backgroung ajax calls and where data, once received is injected in the html DOM.

Have a look at the js:  
https://github.com/natbusa/kernelgateway_demos/blob/master/iris-classifier/static/assets/js/script.js

Here is the jquery code which trains the model and generate the confusion matrix and the classification overlay pic.
```javascript
$("button#train").click(function(){

    var var_x = $("#var_x").val();
    var var_y = $("#var_y").val();
    var model = $("#model").val()
    var path = "/model/train/"+var_x+"/"+var_y+"?model="+model

    $.get(path).done(function(data, status){
        $("#train_output").html("Model: " + data);

        var p1 = $.get("/model/confusion/plot");
        var p2 = $.get("/model/predict/plot");

        $.when(p1, p2).done(function(r1, r2) {
            $("#predict_plot").html(r1[0]);
            $("#confusion_plot").html(r2[0]);

            $("#predict_form").show()
        });

    });
});
```
